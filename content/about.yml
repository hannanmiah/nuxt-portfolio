  Hi, I'm **Hannan Miah**, a Full-Stack Software Developer based in Uttara, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have over 5 years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining robust web applications. I am skilled in Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL, with strong proficiency in Dockerized environments.

  ### My Philosophy

  I am passionate about writing clean, scalable code and delivering efficient, user-centric solutions across the full development lifecycle. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest technologies to provide the best solutions for my clients.

  ### What Drives Me

  I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and creating applications that make a real difference. Whether it's a simple website or a complex ERP system, I approach every project with the same level of dedication and attention to detail.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and participating in tech communities.
